# Hi there, I'm Nguyen Trung Nghia 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm currently a student at the University of Technology and Education Ho Chi Minh City (HCMUTE), where I've discovered my deep passion for all things data. From the moment I wrote my first line of code, I knew that working with data is where I wanted to focus my energy and creativity. Now, I'm on a mission to become a skilled Data Engineer, and this journey is as much about the process as it is about the destination.
